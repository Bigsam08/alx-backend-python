Python annotations are a form of metadata added to Python code, primarily used for type hints. 
They were introduced in Python 3.0 and later formalized for type hinting through PEP 484. 
Annotations can be applied to function arguments, return values, and variable declarations to suggest the expected data types.

#Example:

name: string = "python annoation"
